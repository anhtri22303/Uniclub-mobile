# Profile Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated and enhanced the profile page from the web version to the React Native mobile app with all features including avatar cropping, animations, and improved user experience.

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. **New Component: AvatarCropModal** (`src/components/AvatarCropModal.tsx`)
A React Native modal component for cropping avatar images before upload.

**Features:**
- ✅ Square cropping with visual guide overlay
- ✅ Automatic resize to 400x400 pixels
- ✅ Image compression (80% quality) for optimal file size
- ✅ Beautiful modal UI with cancel and confirm actions
- ✅ Loading state during upload
- ✅ Uses `expo-image-manipulator` for native image processing

**Props:**
- `visible`: boolean - Controls modal visibility
- `onClose`: () => void - Called when user cancels
- `imageUri`: string - The image URI to crop
- `onCropComplete`: (croppedBlob) => Promise<void> - Called with cropped image data

### 2. **Updated: Profile Page** (`src/app/profile.tsx`)

#### Enhanced Avatar Upload Flow
**Before:**
- Direct upload with basic image picker
- No cropping functionality
- Limited validation

**After:**
- 📸 Permission request for media library access
- 📏 File size validation (max 5MB)
- ✂️ Crop modal for image adjustment
- 🎨 Preview before upload
- ✅ Success/error feedback with alerts

#### Points Card Animation
**New Feature:** Dynamic flame icon animation based on points level

| Points Range | Animation | Duration | Scale |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 5000+ | Strong pulse | 800ms | 1.0 - 1.3 |
| 3000-4999 | Medium pulse | 1200ms | 1.0 - 1.2 |
| 1000-2999 | Gentle pulse | 2000ms | 1.0 - 1.15 |
| 0-999 | No animation | - | 1.0 |

**Implementation:**
- Uses React Native `Animated` API
- Smooth scale transformation
- Opacity glow effect
- Native driver for optimal performance

#### Code Improvements
- ✅ Better error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Proper state management for upload flow
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns
- ✅ Added TypeScript types for better type safety
- ✅ Consistent API response handling

### 3. **UserService Verification** (`src/services/user.service.ts`)
Confirmed that the service already matches the web API structure:
- ✅ `fetchProfile()` - Get current user profile
- ✅ `editProfile()` - Update profile information
- ✅ `uploadAvatar()` - Upload avatar with FormData
- ✅ Proper response unwrapping from `{ success, message, data }` format

### 4. **Dependencies Added**
- `expo-image-manipulator` - For native image cropping and manipulation

## 📱 User Experience Improvements

### Avatar Upload Flow
```
1. User taps avatar → Opens image picker
2. User selects image → Validates file size
3. Shows crop modal → User adjusts crop area
4. User confirms → Uploads cropped image
5. Success → Reloads profile with new avatar
```

### Visual Enhancements
- **Admin Users**: Professional navy blue header with clean statistics
- **Students/Club Leaders**: Gradient header (indigo → pink) with animated points card
- **Points Card**: Dynamic styling based on points (purple/pink for 5000+, sky/indigo for 3000+, amber for 1000+, gray for <1000)
- **Flame Icon**: Animated pulse effect that intensifies with higher points

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
// Avatar states
const [uploadingAvatar, setUploadingAvatar] = useState(false);
const [avatarPreview, setAvatarPreview] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Crop modal states
const [showCropModal, setShowCropModal] = useState(false);
const [imageToCrop, setImageToCrop] = useState<string>('');

// Animation refs
const flameAnimation = useRef(new Animated.Value(1)).current;
const glowAnimation = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
```

### Animation Logic
```typescript
// Different animations based on points
useEffect(() => {
  const points = profile?.wallet?.balancePoints || 0;
  
  if (points >= 1000) {
    const duration = points >= 5000 ? 800 : points >= 3000 ? 1200 : 2000;
    const scale = points >= 5000 ? 1.3 : points >= 3000 ? 1.2 : 1.15;
    
    // Start looping pulse animation
    Animated.loop(
      Animated.sequence([
        Animated.timing(flameAnimation, { toValue: scale, duration }),
        Animated.timing(flameAnimation, { toValue: 1, duration }),
      ])
    ).start();
  }
}, [profile?.wallet?.balancePoints]);
```

## 🎨 UI Consistency

### Matches Web Implementation
- ✅ Same avatar crop workflow
- ✅ Similar validation rules (5MB max)
- ✅ Consistent error messages
- ✅ Same API integration
- ✅ Equivalent user feedback

### Mobile-Specific Adaptations
- Native modal instead of web dialog
- Touch-optimized controls
- React Native Animated API instead of CSS animations
- Native image manipulation instead of canvas
- Alert system instead of toast notifications

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Auto-resize to 400x400 (reduces file size significantly)
   - 80% JPEG compression
   - File size validation before processing

2. **Animation Performance**
   - Uses `useNativeDriver: true` for 60fps animations
   - Only animates when points >= 1000
   - Automatic cleanup on component unmount

3. **State Management**
   - Minimal re-renders with proper state separation
   - Clears temp states after successful upload
   - Efficient profile reload after changes

## 📋 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Avatar upload with various image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- [ ] File size validation (test with >5MB file)
- [ ] Crop modal functionality
- [ ] Points card animation at different point levels
- [ ] Profile edit and save
- [ ] Error handling for failed uploads
- [ ] Permission handling for photo library
- [ ] Different user roles (student, club_leader, admin, staff)

## 🔄 Migration from Web to Mobile
