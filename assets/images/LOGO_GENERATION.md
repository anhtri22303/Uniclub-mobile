# UniClub Logo Generation

Since we created a custom SVG UniClub logo component, we need to generate PNG files for:

1. **App Icon** (512x512): `assets/images/uniclub-logo.png`
2. **Adaptive Icon** (1024x1024): `assets/images/adaptive-icon.png` 
3. **Splash Screen** (200x200): For splash screen display
4. **Favicon** (48x48): `assets/images/favicon.png`

## Current Logo Design
Our UniClub logo features:
- Letter "U" and "C" with circuit board patterns
- Blue gradient for "U" (University)
- Teal gradient for "C" (Club) 
- Green connecting circuits representing digital connections
- Signal waves indicating wireless/digital communication
- "DIGITALIZING COMMUNITIES" tagline

## To Generate PNG Files:
1. Use the UniClubLogo React component in a test screen
2. Take screenshots at different resolutions
3. Or use a React Native to PNG converter
4. Or manually create PNG versions using design tools

## Temporary Solution:
Using the existing icon.png as placeholder until custom PNG files are created.
